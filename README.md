# COVID-19
COVID-19 forecasting and modeling with differential equations.

- [COVID-19 Forecasting](https://github.com/Scama99/COVID-19/blob/main/COVID_19_Forecasting.ipynb): This project consists in analyzing the results of forecasting the evolution of a pandemic with three different models: SIR, SEIR and SEID, explained in the document [Modelación COVID-19](https://github.com/Scama99/COVID-19/blob/main/Modelaci%C3%B3n_COVID_19.pdf) from this repository. The main objective of this work is to demonstrate an application of the Euler and Runge Kutta methods to solve differential equation systems.
  
- COVID-19 Modeling: As a part of a larger research project, I was requested to create a compilation of viral disease infection models to compare results with a new agents-based simulation model for COVID-19 developed at the Department of Physics of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Méxco. The code of the agent-based model is still private, but the compilation and analysis of the differential equation based models is available in the notebook [Modelos EDO VID](https://github.com/Scama99/COVID-19/blob/main/MODELOS%20EDO%20VID.ipynb).
