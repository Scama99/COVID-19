COVID-19 forecasting and modeling with diferential equations.
Contents:

- COVID-19 Forecasting: This proyect consists in showing the results of forecastin the evolution of a pandemic with three diferent models: SIR, SEIR and SEID, explained in the document [COVID-19 forecasting](https://github.com/Scama99/COVID-19/blob/main/Modelaci%C3%B3n_COVID_19.pdf) from this repository. The main objective of this work is to demosntrate an aplication of the Euler and Runge Kutta methods to solve diferential equation sistems.
  
- COVID-19 Modeling: *PENDING
